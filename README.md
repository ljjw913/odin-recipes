This is my first complete HTML project in the Odin Project.
I will demonstrate what I have learned so far, inlcuding HTML, Git, GitHub.

The puropse of this project is to create a simple recipe website to demonstrate all the elements in HTML I learned so far, inluding boilerplate, folder and directory management, elements and tags, lists, headings, attributes, etc.
